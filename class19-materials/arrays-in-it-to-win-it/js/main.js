//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = ["National Treasure", "Avatar", "Coraline"];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const firstMovie = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const moviesLength = movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastMovie = movies[-1];
